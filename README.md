# Monty Hall
My attempt at simulating the Monty Hall game show problem in both R and Python.
Both R and Python scripts follow a functional approach. 
However, in R, I actually simulated the doors and Monty Hall closing them. In Python, I took a more direct approach by inverting the initial result on players switching. This way, the R version of the code is more flexible. For instance, in case someone wants to change the number of (wrong) doors Monty Hall opens.
